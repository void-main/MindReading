# MindReading

Pick up what you've left on browser at your phone with one single touch!

## Installation

### Install Chrome plugin
Open Chrome browser, find the `Extensions` menu item from tools menu, in the Extensions page, select `Load unpacked extension..`, choose `frontend/chrome` folder in the file selection dialog, and make sure it's enabled.

### Install the android app
Import the android project in your prefered IDE (make sure you have android development environment properly installed), and install the app to your NFC enabled phone.

### Cast the magic to a NFC tag
Run the `MindReading` app from your phone, and press the `Give me the magic!` button, follow the instructions from the WriteActivity page to cast the magic to your NFC tag

### Read the mind
Now, just browse the pages as usual in Chrome, whenever you need to leave your computer, simply leave the page you are currently reading, and touch your phone to the spelled NFC tag, you can keep on browsing the same page as you've left on your Chrome. Really can read the mind, huh?

## WARNING
### All for one
Now, MindReader don't have any kind of user system, so, basically, whoever that uses MindReading are sharing the content to everyone. 

In my defense, it's quite an interesting feautre, you know, try to read what others thought interesting and try to show the world what you are reading.

On the contrary, if you feel highly insecure or your privacy is offsened, stay with us, we are working on this as a No.1 task for now, so, give us some time, and share something that is approperiate for all of the world.
